<p><b>LINORA</b> is a (web-) LINk ORganizer and Archiver &ndash; it helps you
Organize and Archive you favourite web-links.</p>

<p>The purpose is to help people who use browsers on multiple computers
(tablets, smartphones&hellip;) to avoid the need to wearily create much the
same bookmarks (or favourites, or whatever the browser call them) on each
browser on each computer. (Certain browsers already do that at the cost of you
doing some &ldquo;setting up&rdquo; if you use only that single browser on all
computers etc.: but that doesn&rsquo;t solve the problem if you use different
browsers for some reason.)</p>

<hr width="50%" align="center">

<p>Linora has <!-- four --> three displays: each corresponds to one of the
checkboxes shown at the top of the page: each display starts as
&ldquo;hidden&rdquo;; you can use the checkboxes to turn them on and off in
any combination. They are:</p>

<ul><li><b>HELP</b> (which you&rsquo;ve already found);

    <li><b>ADD</b> which permits you to add a new liks as its&rsquo; URL
        (=web-address), a caption, and (for simple organization) a
        &ldquo;category&rdquo; that you want the link to be recorded in
        &ndash; you can invent whatever categories you like.</li>

    <li><b>LINKS</b> which displays the links you have already added in this
        and prior uses of Linord: the display is a table with one line per
        link, each line starting with the link&raquo;s category, followed by a
        display of the caption in the web tradition as a blue underlined link
        that you can click on to go the the URL. The lines of the table are
        sorted by their categories.</li>

    <!--
    <li><b>REVIEW</b> which in this development version iof Linors is a
        (long!) discussion of the development. Later it will be replaced by a
        NOTES display of whatever the website manager wants to say to you (if
        anything).</li>
    -->

</ul>

<hr width="50%" align="center">

<p><b>Using Linora:</b></p>

<ul><li>For now, the categories are just text without any provided means of
        getting sub-categories: we suggest that if you need subcategories you
        do it with the &ldquo;/&rdquo; character, e.g. with categories such
        as<ul>
            <li>friends/tom</li>
            <li>friends/dick</li>
            <li>friends/harry</li>
            <li>family/mum</li>
            <li>family/dad</li></ul></li>
    <li>The easy way to copy a URL to the ADD display is to have two windows
        open &ndash; one for viewing pages whose URLs you may wish to keep,
        and a another window with just Linora in it, and only the ADD option
        on: you can then click on the URL in the nav-bar of the window with the
        wanted page, and drag the URL into the &ldquo;URL&rdquo; part of
        Linora&rsquo;s ADD display.</li></ul>

<hr width="50%" align="center">

<p><b>In this version of Linora:</b></p>

<ul><li>if you ADD a new link when the links are also displayed in the same
        browser tab, then after a few seconds the new link will be inserted in
        the LINKS display in it&rsquo;s correct &ldquo;category&rdquo;
        position: but if you have ADD and LINKS displays in different tabs or
        windows, then the links won&rsquo;t be updated unless you refresh that
        other tab. (This weakness will be fixed in a future version of
        Linora.)</li>

    <li>if you ADD a link with the category left blank, then it will be
        replaced by a question mark to keep the &ldquo;uncategorized&rdquo;
        entries together in the displayed LINKS table: ADDing with a blank URL
        will effectly add a categorized note to the table: ADDing with a blank
        caption will use the URL as its&rsquo; own caption.</li>

    <li>When you&rsquo;ve added a link, all three parts of the ADD display
        will be cleared ready for the next addition: but when adding a set of
        related links, it would be nice to keep the &ldquo;category&rdquo;,
        either for re-use unchanged, or alternatively slightly edited. We need
        to use Linora for a while before we decide how to provide that reuse
        in a way that&rsquo;s not iritating when you <i>don&rsquo;t</i> want
        reuse.</li></ul>

<p><b>A later version of Linora will also&hellip;</b></p>

<ul><li>include an EDIT option to let you change the categories and captions
        of links you have previously entered.</li>
    <li>have a simple inbuilt &ldquo;subcategories&rdquo; scheme: the
        intention is that if you already used &ldquo;/&rdquo; to define
        subcatories in this version. they will automatically become
        subcategories of the future version.</li></ul>

<p><b>We hope you find Linora useful!</b></p>
